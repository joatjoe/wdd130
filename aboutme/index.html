    <h2>Joe</h2>
    <p>Hello, pretty people! How you doin'?</p>   
    <p>I am Joe. I am from Venezuela, pretty much near the sea, so I haven't seen any season different from hot and hot but rainy (30-33°C always). Aside from the sun wanting to see us from a closer point of view, it is a really beautiful place.</p>   
    <p>I am currently doing a major in Chemistry, but I got curious about this world of programming, so I gave it a go and loved it. I find this course an important tool for my development in Chemistry as well, so I want to learn more.</p>        
    <p>I've been a member since I can remember (more than 20 years). I'll always remember something my leaders back when I was a little girl used to say “Knowledge equals power.” It means that the more knowledge I get, the more opportunities and paths will be at my disposition, thus I'll get more power over my future.</p>
    <p>I really love to learn about different cultures and languages, so if there's anyone who knows anything fun, interesting, new, or any kind of fact your culture has, please do let me know and share with me!</p>
